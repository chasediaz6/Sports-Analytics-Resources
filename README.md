## **ML Models**
Machine learning models and their applications. Resources for deeper understanding. 

### - Principle Component Analysis (PCA) - Dimensionality Reduction
PCA is used to translate data with multiple features into two-dimensions, making the data easier to visualize.

### - Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) - Classification and Regression
XG Boost uses decision trees as base learners, building multiple decision trees sequentially, where each subsequent tree corrects the errors of the previous trees.

- [**Statcast Search**](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search): an application allowing users to access and search through MLB.com's Statcast database. It includes metrics such as Perceived Velocity (PV), Spin Rate (SR), Exit Velocity (EV), Hit Distance (DST), Launch Angle (LA), Batted Ball Direction (BBD), xBA, xSLG, xwOBA, and Quality of Contact. Great for retrieving advanced pitch data.
